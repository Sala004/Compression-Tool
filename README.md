# Compression Tool
This tool is designed for efficient text compression by combining two powerful algorithms: LZSS and Huffman coding. By leveraging this hybrid approach, it achieves high compression ratios, consistently reaching around 70% on ten different datasets. Additionally, it performs compression in less than one second, ensuring both speed and efficiency.
